# Tier it
Welcome to Tier It! Made By Jonathan DiCecco.
![alt text](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/diceccoj/tier-it/main/promo_images/Title.png)

This is an open source tier list maker to make with your friends. Make a room, invite up to 20 people, write questions and rank each other based off of them! (You know, just don't be mean)
I built this project using the Godot Engine, using Google Firebase as my database. The game communicates it using the REST API

## What is a tier list?
A tier list is a list with multiple sections, S, A, B, C, D, and F. S being the best, and F being the lowest. You pick a topic, and rank things depending on which tier you are in. So what if you and your friends can pick a random topic and rank eachother?

## How to Play
- Download the game for your respective OS (Download links below)
- Create an account with an email, password, and username (don't worry if you don't like your username, you can change your username per group of friends!)
- Login. start or join a group of friends with "Rooms". To create a room, enter a unique room name and a code to tell your friends.
- Create an avatar per group!
- As admin you can kick players out of the room as you please (Admin is the person who created the room. If the admin has since left the room, the next earliest person to join the room is appointed admin)
- Create lists with funny question to rank your friends on (again, don't be mean) *Note: only people who were present at the time of the list being made are in te list and can vote. The reason being is because people can come and leave the room as the tier lists are uploaded. Adding people means people will need to rerank players whenever someone is added. This is obviously complicated, can easily break, and probably annoying for the users so lists are restricted to people only present as tier lists are made. People not in a tier list can still view the list however.
- Deactivate lists: Lists are deactivated when everyone in the list has voted OR by the admin's request. In this state, lists are final and cannot be edited.

## Version
v1.2
- Version checking
- The bug fix where the truth values of whether someone voted or not would change into an integer and ruin the rankings.
